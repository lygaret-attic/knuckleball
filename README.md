## Thanks

Thanks to Sam Thorogood for [Deliverd][1], which a lot of this code is inspired by, and Zed Shaw for [Lamson][2],
which was my original inspiration for the concept of roll your own mail handling: this project had a lot of different
goals, but I would still be wrangling with postfix configuration.
